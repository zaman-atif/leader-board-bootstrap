#### This is my first website created with bootstrap. I used the concepts I learned of HTML5, CSS3 , Bootstrap 5 & Font Awesome 5 and applied them to this project.

### This leaderboard website is built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap 5
- CSS3(Used it for some utility classes for the website)
- Font Awesome 5

### What I learned

- I learned how to use bootstrap's flexbox and grid system both properly.
- I learned how to modify bootstrap's navbar and create an interactive responsive navbar.
- I learned how to create a responsive website from scratch in Bootstrap 5.
